Work Done in this Repo:

For State management, i have used Redux here. Using redux there is store setup, Actions, Action Types and Reducers according to the Actions.

Data: For data i have not used any rest API. I am just keeping plain JSON data in js file.

For Routers, I have made 2 pages Home and Album Detail. Home is for list of albums and album detail is for list of photos in that album. both pages using components from component directory.

Whenever end user perform any event like prev photo, next photo and select a photo, we are dispatching that action and reducers updating the state accordingly.

in constant, i have just defined types of actions.

in pipes, we are filtering album based on user.

I am just using plain CSS here. App is not responsive.
